This folder contains files from FINUFFT that cuFINUFFT depend on. Following describes details of dependencies of each file.
- utils.h
  Definitions of CUCPX, CUFFT_TYPE, CUFFT_EX are added and are set depending on preprocessor SINGLE. (See line 50,51,52,74,75,76) 
  Definition of BIGINT is changed to the normal 4 byte integer (See line 81)

- utils.cpp
  This is required because of the use of computing norm, relative norm of vectors, e.g. relerrtwonorm, in the test codes.

- finufft.h
  cufinufft plan contains the nufft_opts struct. Options for setting gpu spreader, interpolator are also added with prefix "gpu_". (See nufft_opts)

- common.h 
- common.cpp (hence contrib/legendre_rule_fast.c/.h are included)
  setup_spreader_for_nufft, set_nf_type12, onedim_fseries_kernel are called in cufinufft_makeplan.
  
- spreadinterp.h
  cufinufft plan contains the spread_opts struct where nspread, spread_direction, pirange, upsampfac, ES_beta, ES_c are used. 
- spreadinterp.cpp
  spreadinterp is called in test/spreadinterp(3d)_test.cu for the accuracy check.
  
- ker_horner_allw_loop.c
- ker_lowupsampfac_horner_allw_loop.c
  These two files are included in the src/2,3d/spreadinterp2,3d.cu files (See device function eval_kernel_vec_Horner)

Following are for test code test/finufft2d.cpp
- finufft2d.cpp
- dirft.h
- dirft2d.cpp
